#Steroids.js Custom Scanner bug

I have a drawer in my app which works in the standard AppGyver Scanner (from AppStore). However, I built a custom scanner via the build service, and the drawer will not work in the custom scanner. Other steroids native UI components seem to be working though I haven't done extensive testing.

Custom Scanner settings:
-I have tried generating scanners both with and without plugins (to make sure the plugin I was trying to use wasn't causing the issue).
-I have created a custom scanner and a custom "debug" scanner. Both have the same issue.
-I have entered 3.1.4 as the version number for both the long and sort version numbers.
